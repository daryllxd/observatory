  <p class="lead">
    Tailwind CSS has revolutionized the way I think about styling web applications. 
    It's not just a framework; it's a new way of approaching CSS.
  </p>

  <h2>The Utility-First Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Tailwind's utility-first approach means you can style elements directly in your HTML,
    without writing custom CSS. This leads to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Faster development</li>
    <li>Consistent design</li>
    <li>Smaller CSS bundle size</li>
    <li>No context switching</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Benefits</h2>
  <p>
    In my experience, Tailwind has several practical advantages:
  </p>

  <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Development Speed</h3>
      <p>No more switching between files to style elements. Everything is right there in your template.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
      <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Maintainability</h3>
      <p>No more CSS specificity wars. Each utility class is independent and predictable.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Getting Started with Tailwind</h2>
  <p>
    To add Tailwind to your project, you can use the following command:
  </p>

  <pre><code>npm install -D tailwindcss</code></pre>

  <p>
    Then initialize your configuration:
  </p>

  <pre><code>npx tailwindcss init</code></pre>

  <p>
    The rest is history! Start using utility classes in your HTML and watch your development speed increase.
