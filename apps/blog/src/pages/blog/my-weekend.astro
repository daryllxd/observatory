  <p>
    This weekend was pretty chill. I spent most of my time working on some coding projects and catching up on reading.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Did</h2>
  <p>
    Saturday was mostly about debugging some Cloudflare Workers issues. It's amazing how something as simple as a KV namespace binding can cause so much trouble when the configuration isn't quite right.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sunday was more relaxed - went for a walk, had some coffee, and just enjoyed the quiet time.
  </p>

  <h2>Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes the best weekends are the ones where you can just take things slow and work on projects that interest you. No pressure, no deadlines, just pure curiosity and learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking forward to next weekend already!
