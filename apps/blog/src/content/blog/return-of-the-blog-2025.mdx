It's been a while since I last wrote anything here. Life has a way of getting busy, and before you know it, months (or years) have passed. But here I am, back at the keyboard, ready to share thoughts, experiences, and maybe a few insights along the way.

## Why the Return?

<Callout bgColor="bg-blue-100" emoji="🎯">
  <strong>Goal for 2025:</strong> Write more consistently, share what I'm learning,
  and build a habit of reflection through writing.
</Callout>

I've always believed in the power of writing as a tool for thinking. When you have to explain something in words, you often discover gaps in your understanding. Writing forces you to organize your thoughts, clarify your ideas, and sometimes even change your mind.

## What's Changed?

A lot has happened since my last post. I've:

- **Watched 750+ movies** (as evidenced by my recent movie reaction post)
- **Continued working in EdTech** - still feeling like one of the "good guys"
- **Learned new technologies** and approaches to development
- **Grown older and hopefully wiser** (though the jury's still out on that one)

<Callout bgColor="bg-green-100" emoji="📚">
  <strong>Learning Never Stops:</strong> I've completed 19 Coursera courses and
  read over 200 books. The journey of continuous learning continues.
</Callout>

## What to Expect

I'm planning to write about:

- **Movie reactions and analysis** - I watch a lot of films and love discussing them
- **Technology insights** - Lessons learned from building software
- **Personal reflections** - Thoughts on career, life, and growth
- **Book reviews** - Sharing what I'm reading and learning

## The Technical Side

This blog is built with Astro and Tailwind CSS - a combination I've come to love for its simplicity and performance. The setup is clean, fast, and easy to maintain. Perfect for someone who wants to focus on content rather than wrestling with complex build systems.

  <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Astro + Tailwind CSS + MDX for a modern,
  performant blogging experience.
</Callout>

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to get back into the rhythm of writing regularly. There's something satisfying about hitting "publish" and putting your thoughts out into the world. Even if no one reads them, the act of writing itself is valuable.

Here's to more posts, more thoughts, and more connections in 2025. Let's see where this journey takes us.
