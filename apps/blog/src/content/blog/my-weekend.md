This weekend was pretty chill. I spent most of my time working on some coding projects and catching up on reading.

## What I Did

Saturday was mostly about debugging some Cloudflare Workers issues. It's amazing how something as simple as a KV namespace binding can cause so much trouble when the configuration isn't quite right.

Sunday was more relaxed - went for a walk, had some coffee, and just enjoyed the quiet time.

## Thoughts

Sometimes the best weekends are the ones where you can just take things slow and work on projects that interest you. No pressure, no deadlines, just pure curiosity and learning.

Looking forward to next weekend already!
